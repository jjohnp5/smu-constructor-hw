# Advanced Javascript Homework
Homeworking showcasing the use of constructors in JS

## Constructors in Javascript
This repository is for SMU Coding bootcamp week 11 assignment. We are tasked to create a command line app that utilizes `inquirer` package to let users guess a random word/words.

### Technologies used
`NodeJS`
`inquirer` package
`colors` package

##### How to use:
* run `node index.js`
* app will ask to input one letter. Only 1 letter is allowed, validation will re-ask you to input a letter and press enter if you put more than 1 letter.
* keep guessing letters until you solve letters for the words.
